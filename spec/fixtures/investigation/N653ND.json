The pilot reported there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\nThe automated weather observation station located on the airport reported that, about the time of the accident, the wind was from 330° at 12 knots. The pilot reported that during the accident flight, the wind was at 12 knots, gusting to 20 knots. The airplane landed on runway 30. &#x0D;",
